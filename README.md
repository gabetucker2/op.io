# Welcome to op.io

## TODO:

* Fix public IsPointInsidePolygon to ensure radius of circle matches and also that it's not colliding at bottom left of circle
* Add outlines to the shapes, soften their edges
* Add acceleration
* Fix collision physics so when destroy is false, it pushes shapes based on weight
* Add health to objects
* Use GameObject more for handling physics, ensure movement updates GameObject position
* Add rotation to player with shooter stick to see which direction you are looking
* Add stochastic floating movement to farm
