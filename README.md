## TODO:

* Fix physics being static
* Add outlines to the shapes, soften their edges
* Add cards I can drag on the side of the screen
* Make each card procedurally generated and an NFT you can trade with other players
* Add acceleration
* Make the screen resizable: square in middle for playing, cards and misc settings in remaining space
* Fix collision physics so when destroy is false, it pushes shapes based on weight
* Add health to objects
* Use GameObject more for handling physics, ensure movement updates GameObject position
* Add rotation to player with shooter stick to see which direction you are looking
