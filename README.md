# Welcome to op.io

## TODO:

* Make static shapes
* --------------
* Fix physics having no acceleration, ensure Player movement uses Physics script
* Add stochastic farm starting rotation
* Add farm hover effect when sitting still
* Hotline miami shift camera movement
* Add collision and physics options to shapes
* Rendering should be object agnostic; polygons, rectangles, and circles, with collision enabled/disabled and physics enabled/disabled
* Make config.json more modular
* Add rotations for all shapes
* Compartmentalize different physics functions
* Add outlines to the shapes, soften their edges
* Add cards I can drag on the side of the screen
* Make each card procedurally generated and an NFT you can trade with other players
* Make the screen resizable: square in middle for playing, cards and misc settings in remaining space
* Fix collision physics so when destroy is false, it pushes shapes based on weight
* Add health to objects
* Use GameObject more for handling physics, ensure movement updates GameObject position
* Add rotation to player with shooter stick to see which direction you are looking
* Add stochastic floating movement to farm
* Add dice rolling mechanic
* Factory rolls out loot
* 80's graphics theme

## Finished:
* Add farm, shapes, polygons, player, player console-agnostic movement
* Fix non circle shape edge artifacting
